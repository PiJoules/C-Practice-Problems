# C pracitice problems
Because I'm a scrub. These problems are from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

1. multiples_of_3_and_5.c
2. even_fibonaci_numbers.c (yes I know it's spelled incorrectly)
3. largest_prime_factor.c
4. largest_palindrome_product.c (could've been done more efficiently)
5. smallest_multiple.c
6. sum_square_difference.c
7. 10001st_prime.c
8. largest_product_in_a_series.c (I have no idea what I was doing)
9. special_pythagorean_triplet.c
10. summation_of_primes.c (I wish I had known about the sqrt thing earlier)
